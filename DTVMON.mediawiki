DTVBOOT/DTVMON is a combination of programs intended for DTV programmers, written by Daniel Kahlin. Typically, DTVBOOT is flashed to $1F8000 and activated by the $1F8000 hook in a kernal patched by [[Kernalpatcher]]. DTVBOOT can do some simple things such as zeroing the DTV RAM, changing video out settings, activating an alternate kernal (typically the [http://jledger.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=dtvhacking&action=display&thread=2721 TRSI kernal]), and launching DTVMON. DTVMON is a machine language monitor adapted for the DTV.

Both programs can also be launched as a RAM version and without a patched kernal (activated using the $018000 RAM reset+left fire hook present in the [[DTV2 Kernal disassembly|standard DTV kernal]]). The drawback of this is that some RAM areas are occupied by DTVBOOT/DTVMON and not available for DTV programming.

Programmers who want to program directly on the DTV will want to put both programs and a patched kernal in the DTV flash. End users typically do not need DTVBOOT/DTVMON at all or can use the RAM version (that can be loaded and started using [[DTVSlimIntro]]).

With VICE emulating the C64DTV, programmers might consider using the much more powerful VICE monitor for DTV programming.
