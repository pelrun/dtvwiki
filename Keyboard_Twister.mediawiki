== About ==
Shadowolf's keyboard twister is an ATtiny45-based hardware solution to fix some issues in the DTV's keyboard emulation as well as mapping german keyboard layout.

== Features ==
* Map german keys properly
** Mapping to other keyboards is also possible. Please contribute any other mappings!
* Fix switched SHIFTs
* Fix F7
* Fix powerup problem (keyboard does not work properly on first startup but only after reset)

TODO:
* "Twister should send $f4 to keyboard (and drop the resulting $fa) whenever it gets $aa. Zee used a PIC that did this to fix a PS/2 'compatible' keyboard (that I happened to own too)." - Nojoopa
* Keeping some mapped keys pressed is visible on DTV side as multiple keypresses. This does not matter in BASIC but is annoying in games (e.g., in Elite decelerating using "/" is very slow).
* Add macro functionality for F9-F12. In record mode (Win+Fx?), write keycodes of keys pressed to EEPROM.

* CKDIV8 has to be disabled (unprogrammed/1) so that the ATtiny runs at 8MHz.
* PC_CLOCK/PC_DATA are C64DTV side.

Programming an ATtiny45 with [http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avrdude/ AVRDUDE]:<br />
<tt>avrdude -p t45 -U flash:w:scancon.hex:i -U lfuse:w:0xE2:m</tt>

OSX with AVR-USB500 SMD:<br />
<tt>avrdude -c stk500v2 -P /dev/tty.usbserial-A20008Du -p ATtiny45 -U flash:w:keyboardtwister.hex:i -U lfuse:w:0xE2:m</tt>

There have been [http://www.forum64.de/wbb3/index.php?page=Thread&postID=229143#post229143 reports] of Keyboard Twister behaving weird because of the two 5k1 resistors. Better leave them away - in circuit programming of the ATtiny can still be done (detach keyboard for programming then).
