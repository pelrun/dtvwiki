==Software Problems==
At LEAST the 041101 revision has a ROM bug regarding the control in "Sword of Fargoal". A battle is automatically fled in the same direction it was entered TO (i.e. west-to-monster will flee west) after one turn, making battles take a long time and require lots of re-entering. If a wall is present in the tile the player will flee TO, and in both of the adjacent tiles in the 8 cardinal directions, the game will get stuck in an infinite loop displaying the monster name and playing the 'entered battle' tune. The original c64 version does not have this problem.

This problem was fixed for the PAL (dtv2/3, released by Toy Lobster) version.  The bug was created when the code was being modified to account for the lack of keyboard on the DTV, and wasn't discovered until the NTSC DTV had gone into production.

==Revisions==
The batch number is "hotstamped" into the plastic on the bottom of the joystick just beside the battery compartment, as shown below. It is not identical to the batch number stamped onto the retail packaging. 
The assumed interpretation is YYMMDD.

[[Image:DTV_v3_batchnum.jpg|DTV batch number]]

The DTV1 had a number of things which varied considerably between (and even within) different batches:
* The PCB was either a C64A version with 3 jumper wires attached to it, or a C64A1 version with those wires integrated into the pcb as traces.
* The direction pad contacts were either made of yellow rubber (generally regarded as superior) or grey rubber.
* The external case was either labeled C=64 or C= Commodore 64 (the latter, as implied by a post by Jeri, were a run of early/prototype cases and the final lot of manufactured cases all read C=64). Oddly the 'C= Commodore 64' cases seem to appear in the LATER batches, perhaps the manufacturer ran out of the 'real' cases and had lots of the 'useless prototype cases' lying around and used those?
