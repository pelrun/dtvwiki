== Getting started ==

==== Quick test ====
If you just want to have a quick look without any hardware modifications, you can go to a BASIC prompt using the built-in [[DTV Easter Eggs|easter egg]]:
* In the blue "READY." screen wiggle the joystick left-right or up-down very quickly.
* Then, ''LOAD"$",8'' instead of ''LOAD"*",8,1'' will be run, giving a list of programs that can be run using the joystick, most notably the BASIC Prompt which features a keyboard emulation that can be accessed with the joystick.

==== Connecting the DTV to the outside world ====
To get data on the DTV, you need to add at least :
* a keyboard port (see [[Keyboard port|keyboard mod]])
* a joystick connector OR a floppy/IEC connector (see [[Joystick_port|joystick mod]]/[[IEC_port|floppy mod]])

==== Power supply ====
Make sure the keyboard gets 4.5 to 5 Volts DC. 6 Volts (4x1.5 Volts normal batteries) will probably fry it!
* Use a regulated/stabilized 5V DC power supply, 500mA or more
** USB chargers and some mobile phone chargers should be okay.
* Or rechargeable batteries (4x1.2V)
* Or a standard/non-regulated power supply (12V,...) with a [http://www.tkk.fi/Misc/Electronics/circuits/psu_5v.html extra regulator] to 5V. Add a 1N4148 protection diode pointing from pin 3 to pin 1 (see [http://www.forum64.de/wbb3/index.php?page=Thread&postID=152909#post152909 here (German)] why<!-- subforum "C64 DTV", topic "Es wird weiter gehackt..."-->)

The DTV board is designed to work with a 3.3V voltage. The built-in '''red power LED''' works as voltage reference in the DTV's [[:Image:dtv2_power_circuit.png|3.3V regulator circuit]] - so don't remove or replace it with a different LED type (1.8V forward voltage needed - especially blue LEDs are not suitable). Replacing this regulation circuit with a linear regulator is possible but seems to reduce power consumption only by about 15% (from ~166mA to ~140mA - [http://jledger.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=dtvhacking&action=display&thread=1555&page=1#10656 PETSCII forum thread]<!-- Topic "DTV PAL power circuitry schematics"-->).

The DTV '''power switch''' wiring is a bit unusual. It connects DTV ''ground'' ("E-") to battery ground in "On" position. In "Off" position, it connects the 3.3V DTV line to DTV ground via a 100 Ohms resistor ("Dis"), probably to discharge capacitors. Keep this in mind when attaching peripherals whose ground connection might bypass the power switch.

* [http://symlink.dk/nostalgia/dtv/colorfix/ Simple colorfix] for DTV2/PAL. In a nutshell: Add three 220Ω SMD resistors (0603 packaging; 0805 also fits) ''in parallel'' to the existing R16, R20, and R24. Also, add one 330Ω resistor (a standard wired one works) from the point between R14 and R16 (the side of R16 pointing away from R20 is okay) to ground. Use a grounding point a bit away from the audio line to prevent noise. 166Ω can be measured on each of the additional resistors if soldering is okay. Reported to work even better than the [http://www.kahlin.net/daniel/dtv/colorfix.php 'true' colorfix] as suggested by Mr. Latchup which requires replacement of 17 (!) SMD resistors.

** Make sure you patch the kernal with [[Kernalpatcher|kernal patcher]] before doing the userport mod since the standard kernal sets PAL/NTSC mode depending on the userport's wiring.

** Bat+ is the batteries' positive pin so it's about 6 Volts with normal batteries (too much for a keyboard!) and about 4,8 Volts with rechargeable batteries
