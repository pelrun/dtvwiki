This is a list of games that has been patched for the [[DTV Version 2/3]]. See [[Userport Patched Games]] for games patched for the [[Hummer]].

Actual repository for games is [http://symlink.dk/nostalgia/dtv/fixed/ Spiff's repository]. This list is intended to document changes both from a gamer's and programmer's point of view. See [[Fixing Games for the DTV]] for a programmer's guide.

Note that some files in the repository extend above $CFFF and cannot be loaded with normal floppy LOAD. See [[DTV_Version_2/3#Some_games_from_Spiff.27s_Repository_fail_to_run_properly._Why_is_that.3F|here]] for details.

= Collections =

== Ebster's collection ==
'''[[Media:ebster_dtv_collection_1.zip|Download]]'''. Spiff ZIP format (suitable for [[DTVFSEdit]] and [[dtvmkfs]]). Contains a lot of freezed games. See [http://www.forum64.de/wbb2/thread.php?threadid=15580 Forum64 thread] for a list of games included. Choplifter was broken and has been replaced by a version by bencao74. The menu has been replaced by [[DTVSlimIntro]]. [[DTVTrans]] has been added. Bubble Bobble has been replaced with the 2p fixed version. Can be flashed easily using [[DTVTrans]] sync. No kernal changes needed. Most of these files have been included in Spiff's repository as individual archives.
