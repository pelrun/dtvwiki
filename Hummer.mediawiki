== Brief Summary ==

The Hummer Off-Road Racing Challenge game was sold by RadioShack for the 2005 Christmas season, it is no longer available through retail channels. While it was not sold as a Commodore device at all, it contains a version 3 DTV ASIC, 2MB RAM and 2MB FLASH ROM. It comes with the Hummer Off-Road Racing Challenge game, which was written specifically for the Hummer hardware. The Hummer off-road racing hardware is functionally equivalent to the DTV3 with the following notable exceptions, different timing Crystal, only 3 of 10 joystick I/O lines and an ADC included on-board. There are additional minimal differences in software related to PAL & NTSC issues. Since the Hummer lacks complete joystick ports a gaming solution has been developed which allows specially [[Userport_Patched_Games| patched games]] that receive control from the userport to be played.   The Hummer hardware also has the same video flaw (and same fix available) as the version 2/3 joystick sold in Europe.

[[Connect a Keyboard]]

[[Connect a Disk Drive]]

[[Fix the Audio Circuit]]

[[Fix the Video Circuit]]

[[Convert the Userport to a Joystick Port]]

[[Flash the Kernal]]

[[Add Software to the Flash]] - for the DTV, this is covered on [[Flash the DTV Rom#Flash new programs]]. However, the Hummer uses a slightly different [[Hummer Kernal disassembly#File Format|flash file format]] for which no tools (dtvpack/[[DTVFSEdit]]) exist. Just flash a DTV2 kernal modified by [[Kernalpatcher]] - then your Hummer will use the DTV2/3 file system. [[DTVSlimIntro]] can be used for starting programs then. Navigation in the intro is possible using cursor keys - userport joystick is not supported.
