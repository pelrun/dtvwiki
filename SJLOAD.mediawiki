==About==
SJLOAD is a C64/C64DTV software [http://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/Fast_loader fastloader]. Its main difference from normal fastloaders is that it only works with Jiffy-enabled drives and uses the Jiffy protocol. This makes it handy for people who have a Jiffy-enabled drive (also new hardware such as [http://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/SD2IEC SD2IEC]) but do not want to make the hardware changes necessary for exchanging the C64 kernal.

SJLOAD speed is a bit higher than normal Jiffy since SJLOAD uses the same protocol but a different implementation (it disables the VICII during load etc.). With an SD2IEC, SJLOAD is about 15% faster than a normal Jiffy kernal. Note that SJLOAD '''does not''' feature the command wedge and function key shortcuts known from a Jiffy kernal.

SJLOAD is loosely based on VDOS (1986) by Edward Carroll. However, the fast loading routines have been replaced completely by [[User:1570|1570]] ([[Special:Emailuser/1570|contact]]).

==Usage==
* LOAD"!",8,1 - autostart SJLOAD
* LOAD"!*PROGRAM",8,1 - autostart SJLOAD, fastload PROGRAM
** Since 1581 (compatible) drives do not stop filename matching at "*", use LOAD"!=PROGRAM",8,1 on these drives.
* LOAD"!",8:REM CHANGE DISK:RUN - save autostarting SJLOAD to (new) disk
* VERIFY - read floppy status - VERIFY"",9 reads status from drive 9
* VERIFY"''command''" - send floppy command
* VERIFY"$" - display directory - scroll to entry and press SHIFT+RUN/STOP to load and run program
If a program crashes on RUN after loading it using SJLOAD, try RUN/STOP+RESTORE (this disables SJLOAD) before RUNning it.

==Status==
'''[http://picobay.com/dtv_wiki/index.php?title=SJLOAD/SJLOAD.ASM&action=history ChangeLog]'''

SJLOAD is far from completed:
* Loading files bigger than 195 blocks makes the C64 crash
* Loading files below $0801 is not supported
* Only few tests have been made (with a C64DTV and an SD2IEC and in VICE)
* No IEC timing fixes for the C64DTV are done so the J1541/J1571+C64DTV combo does not work with SJLOAD (J1581 and SD2IEC ''do'' work). See [[JiffyDOS]] for a DTV solution.

I (1570) probably will not work on SJLOAD any more. The source is there, fix it! :-)

==Download==
* [[:Media:SJLOAD.D64|SJLOAD.D64]] including source for SJLOAD and VDOS. Also includes CRCCHECK, a testing program that repeatedly loads itself and checks its integrity.
* [[SJLOAD/SJLOAD.ASM]] - SJLOAD source in the wiki (just edit it if you have fixes at hand).
