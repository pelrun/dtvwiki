'''This applies to the [[Hummer]] only!'''

As most already know by this point, the hummer only has 3 usable joystick lines, and 1 of those 3 is from a different port. So that means playing games on the hummer is just about useless unless the game can be operated from the keyboard. As most games for the C64 were designed for the joystick, this eliminates 99% of C64 compatible games. However, it is possible to wire up a joystick to the Hummer's userport. The only problem is that software is not designed to look for a joystick on the userport. So to remedy this, games must be "patched" to work with the userport.

'''Note:'''
The kernal needs to be flashed before the a joystick can be wired to the userport.  The Hummer DTV establishes video settings based on high or low voltages on the userport lines during start up.
